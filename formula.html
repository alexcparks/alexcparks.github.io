									<p>A copy of the presentation done at one of the final team meetings is <a href="webMat/Shifting Presentation.pdf" target="_blank">included here</a>.</p>
									<p>For further information about the club please visit the <a href="https://www.qfsae.ca/" target="_blank">Queen's Racing Team</a> official website.</p>
									<p>In the final year of my studies, I was an active member of the Queen’s Racing Team, formerly known as Queen’s Formula. This is a club consisting of more than a hundred individuals, run entirely by volunteer undergrad students and with the objective of conceiving, designing, and building a small formula-style racing car, capable of racing under the Formula SAE rules and regulations.</p>
									<p>I accepted a position as a senior engineer in the powertrain section. I was given a project by the section lead and was responsible for attending a section meeting and a full-team meeting weekly to discuss the status of the car, as well as occasionally give a progress report on my work. My specific project was the adjustment of an existing pneumatic shifting system on the car, which turned into a complete redesign of the system.</p>
									<p>The system consists of a pressure tank connected to a 2-way pneumatic cylinder via two solenoid valves controlled by the ECU. With the expansion or compression of the cylinder actuator, a force was exerted on a lever connected to a dogbox gearbox, shifting the gear. The force required to shift the system depends on several factors such as current gear, engine speed, or lever length, and the force that can be exerted by the actuator depends on tank pressure and bore of the cylinder. The project was a balancing act between exerting enough force and minimizing the mass of air required per shift to reduce the shift time as much as possible.</p>
									<p>At the end of 2021, it became apparent that the university was once again going to close and move to remote learning, I was put in charge of two lower year students, to introduce them to my research and familiarize them with the system. During the remote part of the school year, a challenge was posed to the entirety of the team as there was no access to the workshop or car. Much of the research and design process was theoretical as no tests or measurements could be done. Despite these difficulties, I was able to find the solution for the current system and laid the groundwork for the future development of the new system in the non-pandemic year.</p>
