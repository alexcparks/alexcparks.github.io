									<p>A copy of the final report is <a href="webMat/Noise Control Lab.pdf" target="_blank">included here</a>.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/frequency.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>I was provided with two sets of acoustic data at 15 different locations in the room in the range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz, one set with the pump on and one with the pump off. As can be seen in the graph above, I separated the sound pressure data into an array of 1/3 octave bands from which I was able to isolate the sound pressure levels generated by the pump. Furthermore, because the human ear is more sensitive to mid-range frequencies, I applied the A-weight curve to find the frequencies affecting the human ear, and therefore which frequencies to eliminate. In the graph the most prominent and powerful frequencies can be seen between 1250 Hz and 1600 Hz, these frequencies were important when choosing the thickness of the barrier to be constructed.</p>
									<p>To justify the barrier between the pump and the operator as a potential solution, I built a python simulation on the sound propagation in the room. By assigning the sound pressure levels at different distances a directional value, I solved for the sound power level of the pump next. Next, I built a model of the room in python that yielded the total surface area, sound absorption coefficient, and the room constant. By erecting a barrier between the observer and the pump I aimed to increase the surface area and the sound absorption coefficient while increasing the transmission loss for direct transmission between the source and the operator. With the simulation I was able to justify the solution. The sound pressure level at the operator was dropped by over 4 dB with the barrier. The simulation also produced a sound pressure level of 75.7 dB at the operator without the barrier compared to an experimental 76 dB. The error can be attributed to assumptions made in the absorption coefficient and in the dimensions of the room. </p>
									<p>The proposed solution consisted of a 2.5-inch thick, 2.5-meter-tall, and 4-meter-wide acrylic barrier being placed between the source and the operator. The location, size, and thickness of the barrier were also experimented with, and the most cost-efficient way was chosen. By putting up the barrier, the surface area/room constant was increased, as well as much of the noise getting absorbed via transmission loss. It was estimated that the equivalent exposure time was nearly tripled due to the proposed design.</p>
									<p>This project was primarily an exercise in data analysis and in making proper assumptions for problem-solving. I was quite happy with the design, it was simple but eliminated much of the unneeded noise to the point that earplugs were not necessary, though still recommended. I very much enjoyed applying knowledge from a topic I’m passionate about to solve a real-world problem, the proposed solution to which could be used in the future.</p>
