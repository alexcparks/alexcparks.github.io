									<p>A copy of the final report is <a href="webMat/Noise Control Lab.pdf" target="_blank">included here</a>.</p>
									<p>The goal of this project was to reduce the noise level experienced by an operator caused primarily by the source, which consisted of a pump and motor set and determine an appropriate noise control strategy to limit the noise experienced by the operator and other users of the machine shop where the source is located. The group was provided with 2 sets of data, with the sound pressure level at an array of frequencies and subsequent pressure levels in 1/3 octave bands in the range of 20Hz and 20kHz. The sound pressure level was measured at the location of the operator with the source “off” and at 15 different locations with the source running. The coordinates of these locations were provided, and the dimensions of the enclosed space were also given, however, neither the materials used for the room nor other objects in the shop were described.</p>
									<p>The given problem was unusual, as it was found that the sound pressure level at the operator with only the only noise coming from the source was under the threshold of allowed sound. Though with other sources of noise it would likely exceed this threshold, the lack of information/data given, assumptions, and estimations had to be made for the proposed design. Because the sound pressure level from the source was already under the threshold set by Canadian law, it allowed several different approaches to validate the design. My partner and I agreed on using equivalent time sound exposure, a measurement of the time one could spend exposed to the sound level compared to the equivalent time exposed to the maximum sound level according to limits set by OSHA. </p>
									<p>The proposed solution consisted of a 2.5-inch thick, 2.5-meter-tall, and 4-meter-wide acrylic barrier being placed between the source and the operator. The location, size, and thickness of the barrier were also experimented with, and the most cost-efficient way was chosen. By putting up the barrier, the surface area/room constant was increased, as well as much of the noise getting absorbed via transmission loss. It was estimated that the equivalent exposure time was nearly tripled due to the proposed design.</p>
									<p>This project was primarily an exercise in data analysis and in making proper assumptions for problem-solving. I was quite happy with the design, it was simple but eliminated much of the unneeded noise to the point that earplugs were not necessary, though still recommended. I very much enjoyed applying knowledge from a topic I’m passionate about to solve a real-world problem, the proposed solution to which could be used in the future.</p>
