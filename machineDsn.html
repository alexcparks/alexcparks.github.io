										<h1>Gearbox Design Challenge</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/gearbox.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>A copy of the reports can be found here: <a href="webMat/Phase 2.pdf" target="_blank">Phase 2</a>, <a href="webMat/Phase 3.pdf" target="_blank">Phase 3</a>, and the final and complete report in <a href="webMat/Phase 4.pdf" target="_blank">Phase 4</a>.</p>
									<p>In a team of four, I was tasked with designing a gearbox for a pre-built miniature vehicle. The gearbox was to be designed to maximize the performance of the vehicle in a hill climb event and a top-speed event, between which the team would have a chance to adjust the gearbox but would not be able to remove or add any parts to the assembly. The final design choice had to be fully justified, have a full shaft stress analysis, and satisfy all the design challenge constraints, such as size limit, manufacturing time limit, weight limit, etc.</p>
									<p>The project consisted of 4 phases. The first phase was the analysis of possible vehicle configurations and the development of gear ratios for the events. The team first developed a simple single-stage gearbox focused on high torque for the hill climb event, however, for phase 2 this was updated to be an inverted/shifting mechanism needed to reduce torque in favour of higher RPM output. The second phase focused on the fatigue analysis of the shafts and pinion/gear of the proposed design. In the third phase of the design challenge, the team ran an in-depth analysis of stress at critical points along the shaft to identify any possible locations of failure, due to applied stresses and fatigue stress. Phase 4 was the culmination of all 4 phases where the final proposed design was identified, broken down, and justified.</p>
									<p>Personally, the open-ended problem, where there was no correct or “best” way to come up with a design proved challenging but also quite satisfying. The balancing of the high-torque to high-RPM gear ratios was quite stimulating and I specifically remember the “A-HA” moment when I realized that by inverting the gear ratios, the team could essentially maximize torque in one event and with a quick adjustment, increase the maximum RPM of the vehicle for the top-speed event. Seeing the gear-ratio numbers get converted into a three-dimensional rendering of a working gearbox was one of the most satisfying feelings, and even though the in-person testing of the gearbox was unfortunately canceled due to COVID-19, the design process and the final report only reinforced my love for design and engineering.</p>
									<p>I believe that this report is a great example of my ability to problem-solve and apply the knowledge I have gained over the past few years to a task. Throughout the project, I had to apply my math and coding skills, and use CAD in SolidWorks, while working in a team of 3 others. Most importantly, while many of the skills I used were learned through courses, the basics of gearbox mechanics and construction were self-taught through research and discussion with my peers, as neither I nor my group members had any experience in gearbox design. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to participate and watch the evolution of an idea turning into a real design.</p>
