										<h1>Gearbox Design Challenge</h1>
									</header>
									<p>A copy of the reports can be found here: <a href="webMat/Phase 2.pdf" target="_blank">Phase 2</a>, <a href="webMat/Phase 3.pdf" target="_blank">Phase 3</a>, and the final and complete report in <a href="webMat/Phase 4.pdf" target="_blank">Phase 4</a>.</p>
									
									<p>In a team of four, I was tasked with designing a gearbox for a pre-built miniature vehicle. The gearbox was to be designed to maximize the performance of the vehicle in a hill climb event and a top-speed event, between which the team would have a chance to adjust the gearbox but would not be able to remove or add any parts to the assembly.</p>
									<p>I undertook the development of gear ratios and the functionality of the gearbox. In the first iteration of the design, I noticed that the torque due to the resistive forces was significantly lower than the torque produced by the electric motor, meaning that a gear ratio lower than 1:1 could be used. To maximize the functionality, I implemented a single-stage shifting system in the second iteration of the design, and to simplify construction the gear ratios were inversed between events to reduce torque in favour of a higher RPM output.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/gearRatio.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Seen in the picture above, I created an Excel script that minimized the torque required to achieve the maximum angle of ascent while maximizing the top speed of the vehicle. The program maximized the hill climb event points by finding the gear ratio at which motor stall occurred at the same angle of ascent as the rear wheels first started to slip, while the inverse gear ratio’s resultant minimum RPM and acceleration were constrained to meet a threshold to remain competitive in the top speed event. The script utilized experimental tire friction coefficients with a range of possible assembly weights to find the optimum gear ratio and filter out any gear ratio combinations that were unfeasible.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/gearbox.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Based on the gear ratios, a prototype gearbox was created which would be used in the final competition and a CAD rendering of which can be seen above. The gearbox consisted of a housing, an input shaft, an output shaft, as well as a gear and pinion. Each shaft was designed to mount the gear or the pinion depending on the event and a full critical point analysis was done by considering all discontinuities, keyways, and shoulders. The casing was designed with dovetail joints to allow for easy deconstruction between events.</p>
									
									<p>Personally, the open-ended problem, where there was no correct or “best” way to come up with a design proved challenging but also quite satisfying. Seeing the gear-ratio numbers get converted into a three-dimensional rendering of a working gearbox was one of the most satisfying feelings, and even though the in-person testing of the gearbox was unfortunately canceled due to COVID-19, the design process and the final report only reinforced my love for design and engineering.</p>
