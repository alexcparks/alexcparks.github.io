										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I’m a recent graduate from Queen’s University, with a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. I completed my degree in 4 years, graduating in the Spring of 2022. I am looking for a full-time permanent position to apply the skills and knowledge that I have picked up and mastered in the recent years.  </p>
									<p>I am passionate about design engineering, having been a part of the Queen’s Racing Team in my fourth and final year, and enjoy data processing and analysis, an area that I often focused on in group projects. Due to this, I am skilled at and enjoy coding, with advanced MATLAB and Python knowledge, but also proficiency in C++, HTML, and Excel. I am also capable of and often use CAD programs, specifically SolidWorks, to manage complex parts and assemblies.</p>
									<p>During my time at Queen’s, I have covered and mastered topics such as thermodynamics, machine design, fluid dynamics, and solid mechanics and learned to apply these skills to real-world design and engineering problems. More importantly, I have adopted many new or improved problem-solving strategies, leadership abilities, and creative-thinking skills to efficiently break down problems and propose a solution with implementation. Having worked in dozens of teams with a variety of people from different programs and years, I thrive in an environment that challenges me and allows me to collaborate with people of different skills and backgrounds, and constantly pushes me to do more. </p>
									<p>I have an edge and a unique set of skills, having worked in a mechanics shop and as an assistant HVAC engineer. With experience in both the engineering and the consumer/user side, I believe that I am in an advantageous position when it comes to system and product design in the mechanical engineering field.</p>
									<p>My ultimate goal is to practice engineering and continue doing what I enjoy, primarily data analysis and design work, while learning new and improving my skills and constantly expanding my knowledge.</p>
